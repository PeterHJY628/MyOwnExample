            "   - **Advertising Agencies**: Advertising agencies are businesses that specialize in creating, planning, and executing advertising campaigns on behalf of their clients, the advertisers.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Goals**:\n",

            "   - **Advertising Agencies**: The primary goal of advertising agencies is to help their clients (advertisers) achieve their advertising goals through effective campaign planning, execution, and optimization.\n",
