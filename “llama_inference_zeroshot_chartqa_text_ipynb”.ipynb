            "1. **Role**: \n",
            "   - **Advertisers**: Advertisers are the companies or individuals that create and fund advertising campaigns. They are the ones who want to promote their products or services.\n",
            "   - **Advertising Agencies**: Advertising agencies are businesses that specialize in creating, planning, and executing advertising campaigns on behalf of their clients, the advertisers.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Goals**:\n",
            "   - **Advertisers**: The primary goal of advertisers is to promote their brand, increase brand awareness, and drive sales or conversions.\n",
            "   - **Advertising Agencies**: The primary goal of advertising agencies is to help their clients (advertisers) achieve their advertising goals through effective campaign planning, execution, and optimization.\n",

            "4. **Expertise**:\n",
            "   - **Advertisers**: Advertisers may not have the necessary expertise, resources, or time to handle all aspects of advertising, which is why they often work with advertising agencies.\n",
            "   - **Advertising Agencies**: Advertising agencies have a team of experts with specialized skills in areas like creative development, media planning, and campaign execution, making them better equipped to handle advertising tasks.\n",

            "8. **Time**:\n",
            "   - **Advertisers**: Advertisers may not have the time to handle all aspects of advertising, which is why they often work with advertising agencies.\n",
